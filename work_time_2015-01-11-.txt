it was not completely correctly ordered
it is "ddr4 (sdram chips)"
but should be "(ddr4 sdram) chips"
-1420

1651-
1700: the latest example ordering is fixed
now the problem with lar , see line 54, has disappeared, it should be easy now
and i should not use the way i tried at night, it probably would not work correctly, i think, because translation and english trees would be inconsistent. now i have edited english tree inside translate function.
and now even if i moved lar upper , it then "automatically" moved back by later code:
( ... (микросхема сы) ) лар
->
... ((микросхема лар) ы)
this fact of tatar language shows that it is also technically is not "(... микросхема) лар" as i did it ... but "... (микросхема лар)" as i have started to do in english. i will try same way in tatar.
1730 : done , the latest example translation is fixed.
1732 : other examples are ok

same way as i moved plural s (see line 76) suffix into inner level, i am not sure about article position now in "an abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory":
it is now and was:
an (abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
but maybe  i should make it
(an abbreviation) (for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
i left it for now as it was

1 more example is done, 5th started with order_3

-1632-
-1635

1913-
also i am not sure about precedence of top verb suffix now, as i am not sure about plural suffix and article, see line 85
i used to "order"
DDR3 SDRAM is a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface, and has been in use since 2007
as:
(
	(DDR3 SDRAM)
	(
		(be a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface)
		(, and (have been in use since 2007))
	)
)
s

maybe i should make it other way. example:
(DDR3 SDRAM)
(
	(is a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface)
	(, and (has been in use since 2007))
)

i change my mind back
i feel it as "(zur kitap) lar", "(big book) s" ; " (sdram be ... ) s " ; but "(an abbreviation) (for ...)" is ok, i think, but if it is with "the" it should be "the (abbreviation (for ...) )" . also making "an (abbreviation (for ...) )" is also ok. so i change my mind back.
now i am going to change "sdram chips" to "(sdram chip) s".

i have moved plural s upper but it stays as it was in "different signaling voltages, timings"
maybe i will make it functional in both cases (of location of s)

i am going to use 1 verb suffix at upper level if it is same for 2 sides of logical, and left them in 2 sides of logical, if one is present simple and second is past simple

be in use since 2007
i think i made it in previous order function as:
(be in use) (since 2007)
i think now it should be:
be ( (in use) (since 2007) )
but i think first is also ok and i am going to leave that way, it is standard flow, precedence, last preposition block are separated firstly
-1505

1810-
i made quotes as "" but i should use not a level but an "attribute", as i did.
1813: done.
-1824

the 5 sentences about ddr3 are ready

-0206-
-0211-
but i was a little wrong, the latest example translation is not very ready, because "an" position in tatar, it is very long away from "abbreviation":
бер өченче төрдәге икекатлы мәгълүмат тизлегенле синхрон динамик теләсә-ничек керүле хәтер өчен аббревиатура

i am going to translate the examples that was before ddr3 examples
good school
last know
last known
last known bug
read last known bug
the last known bug
read the last known bug
read (past participle)
have read
read-ed the last known bug
have read-ed the last known bug
he have read-ed the last known bug
he have-s read-ed the last known bug
the teacher whom we have met has read the bug that was mentioned
i go to school every day
we go from park every morning
they walk through park that is built last year
the boy that bought a bicycle walks through park
last year
they walk through park
they walked through park last year

this is not true: then 2 examples are left of ddr3 text
-1635

1739-
i have tried the old examples and i see:

good school -> Әйбәт мәктәп - first capital letter of sentence should be fixed

last know -> Соңгы бел - there should be: соң бел

last known -> Соңгы бел лгән - should be: Соңгы беленгән

these are incorrectly ordered:
last known bug
read last known bug

lowercase first letter of sentence is fixed using sh_trees_and_result
-1350

1412-
1420: lowercase first letter of sentence is fixed using s_nstd_to_str_3 ...

i think "last know" is not correct and remove it
is
last known bug
(last known) bug
or
last (known bug)
?
i made it the first way in index2.php . i think it so.
"last known bug" is ordered
-1516

1641-
"read last known bug" is ordered
i comment out "last known bug" because it is included in the next example
also "last known"
i think "read last known bug" is strange, it should be "read the last known bug"
i try it
the 2 examples are ready:
соңгы беленгән баг укы
соңгы беленгән багны укы

begin new example
hm! i see there are no more planned ddr3 sentences are left!
i think what licence should i use if i publish my work
-1700

2002-
i remember the old examples are left
i see "read the last known bug" was already planned
several next examples:
"read" (past participle) - this is not possible to make, i think
"have read" - i start it
2022: almost ready: "укылган тот"
"read-ed the last known bug" - i think this is not possible to make
"have read-ed the last known bug" - i start it
2024: it is almost ready: "соңгы беленгән багны укылган тот".
i comment out the previous example.
"he have read-ed the last known bug" - i start this by modifying the latest example. this does not work, v-0 has appeared, i think it is not possible to make it, and it is really not a correct sentence
"he have-s read-ed the last known bug" - i start this
2029: it is ready: "ул соңгы беленгән багны укыды"
next examples:
the teacher whom we have met has read the bug that was mentioned
i go to school every day
we go from park every morning

2256: "the teacher ..." is ordered
2307: ready: "без очраткан укытучы искә алынган багны укыды"
- "the"s removed here, may be i should use some words for them, like this:
"шул без очраткан укытучы шул искә алынган багны укыды"
but let it stay as it is
and it is already going to be that way, if the teacher or the bug were mentioned in text...
i have set that "bug" was used in current paragraph in function used_in_current_paragraph and the translation is:
без очраткан укытучы шул искә алынган багны укыды
also other examples have changed:
шул соңгы беленгән багны укы
ул шул соңгы беленгән багны укыды

need to join complex nouns that include prepositions and adverbs
example:
neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random access memory (RAM)
in "be neither ..."
in case of "be" thing after "be" usually belong to object of "be"
but there are some cases when adverb specifies "be" itself: is rarely

i should make:
walk through park that is built last year
and maybe these, they are somewhat temporarily fixed:
be the higher-speed successor to DDR and DDR2 and predecessor to DDR4 synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) chips
be neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random access memory (RAM)
how can i make:
walk through park that be v-s build ed-pp (last year)
walk through park (that be v-s build ed-pp last year)
i want to try to join blocks with 'that'. but i have fixed it other way.
need to fix:
(be build ed-pp) (last year)
should be:
be ((build last year) ed-pp)
or:
be ((build ed-pp) (last year))
i select first
they walk through park that is built last year
is ready:
алар узган ел төзелгән парк аша йөрей
next examples:
the boy that bought a bicycle walks through park
last year
they walk through park
they walked through park last year
next is almost ready:
велосипед сатып алган малай парк аша йөрей
translation of 'the' should be fixed

there are evident and nonevident forms of past verb in tatar.
i think nonevident is default and change to it,
i.e. it was де, i change it to гән.

13:56 i have fixed the "in computing, ..." bug.
i see i should not translate
with ... interface
as ... интерфейс белән
but as ... интерфейслы
-1358
1519-
интерфейслы is temporarily fixed
now i see
бер ((...-ле интерфейслы ... хәтер -ның) яңа төре)
should be transformed to
((...-ле интерфейслы ... хәтер -ның) бер яңа төре)
or even ordered that way in english, but as i remember, i specially ordered it this way.
done, changed in tatar.
so:

DDR3 is a DRAM interface specification.
DDR3 — DRAM интерфейсы бер спецификациясе.

In computing, DDR3 SDRAM, an abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory, is a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface, and has been in use since 2007.
Компьютер гыйлеме эчендә, өченче төрдәге икекатлы мәгълүмат тизлегенле синхрон динамик теләсә-ничек керүле хәтер өчен бер аббревиатура DDR3 SDRAM-ы — бер югары үткәрүчәнлек ("икекатлы мәгълүмат тизлеге") -ле интерфейслы динамик теләсә-ничек керүле хәтер (DRAM) -ның бер яңа төре, һәм 2007-дән алып кулланылыш эчендә булган.

going to commit.
i have made all examples but some parts are done very weakly. it is complex nouns with inner prepositions in complex verbs, their prepositions could be separated at verb level but i need to leave them to be separated only inside a noun. they or some of them are:

be neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random access memory (RAM)
it is not "be with", it is "compatible with".
it is not "be of", it is "type of".
it is not "be backward compatible", it is "forward nor backward".

walk through park that is built last year
it is not "walk that", it is "park that".

be a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface
it is not "be with ... interface", it is "... memory with ... interface".
it is not "be of", it is "type of".
