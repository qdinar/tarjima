it was not completely correctly ordered
it is "ddr4 (sdram chips)"
but should be "(ddr4 sdram) chips"

1700: the latest example ordering is fixed
now the problem with lar , see line 54, has disappeared, it should be easy now
and i should not use the way i tried at night, it probably would not work correctly, i think, because translation and english trees would be inconsistent. now i have edited english tree inside translate function.
and now even if i moved lar upper , it then "automatically" moved back by later code:
(... микросхема) лар
->
... ((микросхема лар) ы)
this fact of tatar language shows that it is also technically is not "(... микросхема) лар" as i did it ... but "... (микросхема лар)" as i have started to do in english. i will try same way in tatar.
1730 : done , the latest example translation is fixed.
1732 : other examples are ok

same way as i moved plural s suffix into inner level, i am not sure about article position now in "an abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory":
it is now and was:
an (abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
but maybe  i should make it
(an abbreviation) (for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
i left it for now as it was
