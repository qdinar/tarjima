it was not completely correctly ordered
it is "ddr4 (sdram chips)"
but should be "(ddr4 sdram) chips"

1700: the latest example ordering is fixed
now the problem with lar , see line 54, has disappeared, it should be easy now
and i should not use the way i tried at night, it probably would not work correctly, i think, because translation and english trees would be inconsistent. now i have edited english tree inside translate function.
and now even if i moved lar upper , it then "automatically" moved back by later code:
( ... (микросхема сы) ) лар
->
... ((микросхема лар) ы)
this fact of tatar language shows that it is also technically is not "(... микросхема) лар" as i did it ... but "... (микросхема лар)" as i have started to do in english. i will try same way in tatar.
1730 : done , the latest example translation is fixed.
1732 : other examples are ok

same way as i moved plural s (see line 76) suffix into inner level, i am not sure about article position now in "an abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory":
it is now and was:
an (abbreviation for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
but maybe  i should make it
(an abbreviation) (for double data rate type three synchronous dynamic random access memory)
i left it for now as it was

also i am not sure about precedence of top verb suffix now, as i am not sure about plural suffix and article, see line 85
i used to "order"
DDR3 SDRAM is a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface, and has been in use since 2007
as:
(
	(DDR3 SDRAM)
	(
		(be a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface)
		(, and (have been in use since 2007))
	)
)
s

maybe i should make it other way. example:
(DDR3 SDRAM)
(
	(is a modern type of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface)
	(, and (has been in use since 2007))
)

i change my mind back
i feel it as "(zur kitap) lar", "(big book) s" ; " (sdram be ... ) s " ; but "(an abbreviation) (for ...)" is ok, i think, but if it is with "the" it should be "the (abbreviation (for ...) )" . also making "an (abbreviation (for ...) )" is also ok. so i change my mind back.
now i am going to change "sdram chips" to "(sdram chip) s".

i have moved plural s upper but it stays as it was in "different signaling voltages, timings"
maybe i will make it functional in both cases (of location of s)

i am going to use 1 verb suffix at upper level if it is same for 2 sides of logical, and left them in 2 sides of logical, if one is present simple and second is past simple

be in use since 2007
i think i made it in previous order function as:
(be in use) (since 2007)
i think now it should be:
be ( (in use) (since 2007) )
but i think first is also ok and i am going to leave that way, it is standard flow, precedence, last preposition block are separated firstly

i made quotes as "" but i should use not a level but an "attribute", as i did.

i had commentted out verb ending and dash codes in translation, now i need to write correct program again, what i did previously does not work correctly, maybe because order is changed.
